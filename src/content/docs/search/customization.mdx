Freespoke offers a number of options to customize your search results. Customization
can be done on search results page, or by changing your account's search settings.

## Search Result Filters

Freespoke allows you to filter results by political bias or by date.

![Search Bar Filter Options](../../../assets/search/search_filter_bar.png)

Visit <a href="https://freespoke.com" target="_blank">Freespoke</a> and enter a
term into the search bar. Hit enter or tap the search button. Once results load,
tap the "Filters" button just below the search bar. Drop downs will appear
allowing you to filter by the date at which the content was published, or by the
political bias of the publisher. Visit our [Bias](/about/bias) page to learn
more about how Freespoke rates publisher bias.

## Account-Level Filters
