## Why Freespoke Premium?

Freespoke Premium provides a number of benefits. With Premium, you get access to
special features unavailable to other users such as the ability to block sites
forever from your search results. You'll also never see an ad, either in our
news feed, or in your search results. With Premium enabled in our mobile apps
for Android and iOS, you automatically get our ad blocker that prevents you from
seeing annoying ads on every site you visit.

Freespoke Premium is also the best way that you have to support our mission.
When we started Freespoke, we decided up front that we were going to break,
well, all the rules. Traditional Big Tech search monitors your activity across
the entire internet. It tracks everything you do, and builds profiles of you in
order to offer access to your eyeballs to advertisers and data brokers.
Traditional Big Tech search is biased. Sometimes purposefully, sometimes
accidentally, but biased nonetheless. Freespoke is very intentionally unbiased.
Tradition Big Tech search is a minefield for your kids. Sure, there's a safe
search option, but it's extremely lax by default, hard to find, and unenforcable.
Freespoke simply doesn't index or display pornographic videos, images, or web
links. Unlike Big Tech, Freespoke is a partner in protecting kids online.

Building a search engine is hard work. Building a search engine that puts your
interests ahead of the interests of advertisers and data brokers is harder yet.
It's not just hard -- it's expensive. Your Freespoke Premium subscription allows
us to continue our work creating a private, unbiased, porn-free search engine.
