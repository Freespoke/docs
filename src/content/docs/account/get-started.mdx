Your account is your gateway to many Freespoke features. It's the gateway to
[Freespoke Premium](/premium/overview), and a way to support Freespoke's mission
of unbiased, private, porn-free search that puts humans first.

## Sign Up

You can create an account using your email address, or by connecting your Apple ID.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Email Sign Up" icon="email">
    To join Freespoke using your email and a password, visit our <a href="https://freespoke.com/signup" target="_blank">registration page</a>.

    Complete the form fields (all are required!) and click "Create Account".

    <Aside type="tip" title="Password Requirements">
        Both password fields must match in order to continue, and your password
        must meet some minimum criteria for strength:

        * At least 8 characters long.
        * At least one number and uppercase character.
        * May not be the same as your email.
    </Aside>

    <Aside type="danger" title="Password Tips">
        * Do not share your password with anyone.
        * Do not reuse the same password on Freespoke as on any other site or account.
        * We highly recommend a password manager to secure your online accounts. Freespoke recommends 1Password.
    </Aside>
