We launched Freespoke because information is the life blood into society and we saw that we couldn’t trust Google with this important aspect of our lives.

> "An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people."

Our society has grown accustomed to getting our information from the worlds largest advertising company. We've seen that this incentive structure leads to a system which prioritizes enticing users towards paid content (even fooling users into choosing a paid result over an unpaid one). But even more nefariously, it also provides a powerful system for information control -- a system Google has not hesitated to deploy in the interest of viewpoints or candidates they or their employees support.

Your information engine shouldn’t have an opinion.

At Freespoke we’re building the future of the internet. We want to bring back the internet as it was always supposed to be. A place for the exchange of knowledge, opinion, information. We're building Freespoke to be a place for all. A place for all ages, without fear of pornographic content. A place for all political perspectives. A place where, without fear nor favor, you can trust that you're getting the full picture.

> Don’t think you’re going to conceal thoughts by concealing they ever existed.

> *Dwight D. Eisenhower*

Philosophers debate. Founding Fathers debate. Supreme Court justices debate. Free citizens debate. The free and respectful exchange of ideas is the only way to maintain a democratic system of government.

### Privacy

Big Tech thrives off an exploitative and oppressive business model.

Google owns [two of the top three sites on the internet](https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million). Google Analytics is present on [over 80% of the sites on the web](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/traffic_analysis) as of October 14, 2024. Everywhere you go, whether on a Google-owned domain, or on a site where google analytics or google ads appear, they’re knitting together a profile about you that they use to make money off of your attention.

Opt out of Google and Big Tech exploitation by choosing Freespoke. By changing the business model, together we can create an alternative that works towards goals we all share -- goals that lead to mutual flourishing, not a winner-take-all model.

### Anti-Human Trafficking

Online pornography is the [third most common form of sex trafficking](https://polarisproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Polaris-2019-US-National-Human-Trafficking-Hotline-Data-Report.pdf). Nick Kristof of the New York Times writes that ["Google supports the business models of companies that thrive on child molestation"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html). Fight The New Drug writes about how [porn fuels sex trafficking](https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-can-fuel-sex-trafficking/).

Freespoke's choice is to opt out of corrupt and incumbent systems and businesses. The porn industry thrives on illicit and illegal behavior, and relies on early exposure to addict new audiences. Freespoke makes every effort to be a partner for parents and to everyone who wants to avoid explicit content. We all know the internet is full of pornography. Freespoke is not.
