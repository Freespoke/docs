# Bias Ratings

Freespoke provides context to your searches and our news feed by labeling
publisher political biases. Where possible, your results will indicate whether
the publishing website is left- or right-leaning, or whether it tends to play it
straight with its reporting.

## Sourcing

We source our publisher labels from third parties such as [Ad Fontes](https://adfontesmedia.com/)
and [AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/).

## Limitations

* Because our labels operate at the publisher level, we cannot account for the
perspective of individual authors. If a liberal publisher employs a conservative
editorial writer, our system will still label the content as left-leaning. We
are considering more fine-grained labeling of authors or individual articles in
the future.
* Because we rely on third-parties for our ratings, we cannot provide
comprehensive assessments of each and every publisher. Our sources provide solid
coverage of popular websites, but for less well-known sites, our bias ratings
have a lower coverage rate.

Due to these limitations, you should always do your own research. Freespoke is
a partner in your goal of understanding the varying perspectives on any topic,
but in order to gain a truly deep understanding, each individual must still read
and study on their own. We aim to assist in that mission.
